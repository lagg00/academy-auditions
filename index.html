            <h3>Is this an official company?</h3>
            <p>
              No. This is an independent, faith-based project. The goal is to
              build a serious, structured group from the ground up, not to copy
              a big company, but the expectations are still strict.

          <article class="na-faq-item">
            <h3>Can I audition if I’m not Korean?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. You do not need to be Korean to audition. The concept is K-pop
              style, but applicants may be from any background.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="na-faq-item">
            <h3>Is there a fee to audition?</h3>
            <p>
              There is no fee to submit your online audition. If additional costs
              appear later (for example, travel or lessons), those will be clearly
              explained to parents or guardians before any decisions are made.

          <article class="na-faq-item">
            <h3>How long until I receive a reply?</h3>
            <p>
              Because this is a small team, review may take
              <strong>4–6 months</strong>. Only selected applicants, and their
              parents/guardians, will receive follow-up communication.
