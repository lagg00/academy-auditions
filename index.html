        <h2>What is New Academy?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>New Academy</strong> is the name of this audition program. It is
          <strong>not</strong> the final name of the group. We’re an independent, faith-based
          project created by people who love K-pop and want to use it to share a positive
          Christian message.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are <strong>not a big label</strong>. We don’t have huge resources,
          big company backing, or a guaranteed fast debut. Things might move slowly.
          It may take time to grow, build a fanbase, and even to form the final group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we’re small, there is <strong>no promise</strong> that this project will
          become super famous quickly or at all. We will do our best, work hard, and stay
          faithful—but success can be slow. If you join, you’re joining a journey,
          not just a result.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Can Join?</h2>
        <p>
          This audition is for <strong>boys ages 12–14</strong> at the time of audition.
          We’re looking for people who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are passionate about music, performance, or visuals</li>
          <li>Are willing to train, practice, and grow over several years</li>
          <li>Are kind, respectful, and able to work in a team</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You do <strong>not</strong> need to be perfect. You do need to be willing
          to learn, be corrected, and keep trying.
        </p>

        <h2>Faith & Mission</h2>
        <p>
          This is a <strong>Christian K-pop group</strong> project. Our songs and content
          will include themes of faith, hope, and God’s love. Members should be comfortable
          with Christian lyrics, prayer, and talking about faith.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We may decline events or opportunities that conflict with our values.</li>
          <li>We care more about character and message than popularity.</li>
          <li>We want to show you can be in entertainment while honoring God.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Training & Timeline</h2>
        <p>
          If you are chosen as a trainee, there may be a training period of
          <strong>2–5 years</strong> before any official debut. Training could include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vocal practice / rap practice</li>
          <li>Dance lessons and choreography training</li>
          <li>Performance skills and stage presence</li>
          <li>Content creation and social media activity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Training and being in a group is <strong>hard work</strong>—long hours,
          repetition, and high expectations. It can also be fun, rewarding, and
          life-changing if you’re truly passionate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the group debuts, we may ask for a <strong>multi-year commitment</strong>
          (for example, 5 years) so that we can grow, release music, and build a real
          community together.
        </p>

        <h2>Group Culture & Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          We want to build a <strong>family-style group</strong>, not a toxic or
          competitive environment.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no “king of the group.” Everyone matters.</li>
          <li>Members must be kind, supportive, and encouraging.</li>
          <li>Communication is important—if something is wrong, speak up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No strict or unhealthy dieting will be required. Health and safety come first.
        </p>

        <h2>Social Media & Public Life</h2>
        <p>
          If you are chosen, you will need to be comfortable:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having your face and name online</li>
          <li>Posting content for fans</li>
          <li>Being seen as a public figure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We’ll aim to guide you to use social media safely and wisely, but privacy
          will be different from a normal life.
        </p>

        <h2>Reality & Growth</h2>
        <p>
          This project is real, but it is also experimental and small. There is a chance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We may grow slowly</li>
          <li>We may not go viral quickly</li>
          <li>Things may change over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please audition because you love the mission and the art, not just
          because you want fast fame.
        </p>

        <h2>Parents & Guardians</h2>
        <p>
          Parents/guardians must approve the audition and support the child
          during the process. Training, travel (if it happens), schedule changes,
          and online visibility all affect the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          By submitting this audition, you confirm that a parent/guardian has
          read this information and agrees to be involved.
