            <h3>Do I have to be Korean?</h3>
            <p>
              No. You don’t need to be Korean to audition. We welcome applicants from any
              background who love K-pop, love Jesus, and are willing to work hard.

            <h3>Where will training happen?</h3>
            <p>
              Training will start online and locally (depending on where selected members
              live). As the project grows, we may gather in person more frequently for
              rehearsals, recordings, and events.

          <article class="na-faq-item">
            <h3>Is there a cost to audition?</h3>
            <p>
              There is no fee to submit an online audition. If you pass, there may be some
              costs related to lessons, travel, or equipment, but we’ll always communicate
              clearly before asking for any commitment.

            <h3>How long until I hear back?</h3>
            <p>
              Because we’re a small team, reviewing auditions may take
              <strong>4–6 months</strong>. Please be patient and keep checking the parent
              or guardian email you provide.
