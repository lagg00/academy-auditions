          <h3>1. Program identity</h3>
          <p>
            “New Academy” is the name of this <strong>audition and training program only</strong>.
            It is not the final group name. If a group debuts, a separate official group name
            will be chosen later.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an <strong>independent, faith-based project</strong>. It is not a major
            entertainment company, but expectations and standards will still be strict, clear,
            and professional.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>2. Age requirement</h3>
          <p>
            This audition is currently open to <strong>boys ages 12–14</strong>. Your date
            of birth will be checked in Part 1. If your age does not fall within this range,
            your application will not move forward.

        </section>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>3. Training length</h3>
          <p>
            Training will last from approximately <strong>5 months up to 2 years</strong>.
            The exact length depends on each member’s progress. No one debuts until they are
            ready in skill, discipline, and maturity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Training may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Regular vocal and/or rap practice</li>
            <li>Dance training and choreography rehearsals</li>
            <li>Stage performance and camera presence practice</li>
            <li>Team communication and group coordination</li>
            <li>Basic content creation and social media practice</li>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>4. Commitment after debut</h3>
          <p>
            After training and debut, members will be expected to commit
            <strong>at least 5 years</strong> to the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            During those 5+ years, members may be involved in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Recording songs and performance videos</li>
            <li>Filming content and promotional material</li>
            <li>Maintaining a consistent public image</li>
            <li>Group activities, rehearsals, and potential live opportunities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is not a short-term activity or a temporary club. The plan is to build
            something long-term with members who are ready to stay and grow.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>5. Christian focus</h3>
          <p>
            This project is intentionally <strong>Christian</strong> in its message
            and values. Songs, visuals, and public behavior must reflect those values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Members do not need to be perfect, but they must be willing to represent
            a Christian message publicly, including online. If you are not comfortable
            with that, this is not the right program for you.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>6. Roles and structure</h3>
          <p>
            The All-Rounder role has already been selected. The open positions are:
            <strong>Main Vocalist, Main Dancer, Main Rapper, and Main Visualizer</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no single permanent “leader” of the group. Members may have
            different responsibilities, but respect is expected in all directions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>7. Work ethic and attitude</h3>
          <p>
            Members must be able to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Show up on time to scheduled practices and calls</li>
            <li>Take feedback without arguing or shutting down</li>
            <li>Balance school, family, church, and group responsibilities</li>
            <li>Communicate clearly with the team instead of disappearing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If a member repeatedly refuses to practice, communicate, or cooperate,
            they may be removed from the program.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>8. Social media and public image</h3>
          <p>
            Members will be encouraged and expected to be active on social media
            in a safe and controlled way. This may include sharing training progress,
            posting content, and interacting with supporters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Posts must stay respectful, appropriate, and consistent with the project’s values.
            Extremely negative, inappropriate, or harmful content online can lead to removal
            from the group, even after debut.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>9. Parents and guardians</h3>
          <p>
            A parent or guardian must be aware of this application. They must understand
            that this is a long-term, public, and serious project. Their support is
            important, especially for younger applicants.
          </p>
          <p>
            All official communication will go through the parent/guardian email
            provided in Part 1.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="na-terms-section">
          <h3>10. No guarantee of selection</h3>
          <p>
            Submitting this application does not guarantee selection, training, or debut.
            Many factors are considered, including skill level, attitude, availability,
            and group fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not selected, it does not mean you have no potential. It simply
            means this specific project is not the right match at this time.
